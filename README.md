# Face-and-mood-detection
Using landmarking technique and opencv.

In the input data I have given the features of my and one of my favourite author - Kurt Vonnegut's face.
So as output it will detect my and Kurt's face, putting a rectangle around the face along with name of the person.
The input data can be increased and some more faces can be added to make the algorithm more diverse in recognises the faces of different persons (according to our needs).
